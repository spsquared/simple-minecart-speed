# SP^2 Minecart Speeds

A very simple mod that adds a way to make minecarts not useless for transportation.

### Features
* Minecarts preserve their velocity when going off rails
* Ground drag (when the minecart rolls on the ground) is different for pickaxe mineables, axe mineables, ice, and air.

TODO:
* Preserve vertical velocity when leaving rails
* Add "trimmed" rails crafted using normal rails and some block to change the max speed (texture will likely have a thin strip of color like powered/activator rails)
